# Web_Scraping_Multi_page

#### Coding Bat

This is my personal project for web scarping for multiple pages.  <br>
There is a website for practicing java and python, which is Coding Bat.  <br>
From this website, I want to pull out the question statement from each question.  <br>
Steps:  <br>
1. Get link
2. Find class for questions
3. Get question statements from each question.
